 generic.3.desc:0 "Please be aware that Across the Dnieper is still in beta, so there is still a lot of content to come, and we are working very hard to bring it to you. If you have any questions or just want to join a nice, welcoming community, please check out the AtD Discord server.\n\nA couple of recommendations:\nFirstly, we have an official music mod, the link to which can be found in our steam's description.\nSecondly, while the mod can be played with or without any of the DLCs, we recommend BBA, NSB, LaR and MtG, as the game is primarily designed and coded with those in mind. Not too important, but still worth accounting for if you choose to play without those DLCs enabled.\n\nWith that out of the way, we hope you have fun and come back to the mod in the future!"

 generic.6.desc:0 "Russia is currently undergoing a hefty rework, and you are currently playing part two of four(?) updates. Please note that there are currently no alternate history paths, wagner mutiny, and some of the features are 'undercooked' or lack purpose (the media and united russia mechanics). Please know that these are being used for said alt-history paths, which are currently in development - for example if you want to coup Putin, you need your faction to have X amount of power, etc.\n\nIf you want to access the old Russian tree, you can do so by a game rule near the bottom, and while utmost care has been taken to preserve it, it may be slightly different due to how hard it is to implement parralel content to this extent in a HoI4 mod.\n\nAnyways, please enjoy the content!"
