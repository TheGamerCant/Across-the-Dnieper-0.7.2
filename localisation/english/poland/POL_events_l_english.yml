Kaczyński has had a long career in Polish politics and ran for President back in 2010.

It involves recordings of several PO officials, such as the foreign and interior ministers, dining with financial officials of both the EU and Poland, with each having the bare necessities of a 500 Euro meal being subsidised by the Polish taxpayer.\n\nAt this meeting they made numerous disgusting remarks, notably foreign minister Sikorski describing Poland's relationship to America as being like "sucking America's penis," and Elzbieta Bienkowska, the current EU internal market commissioner, was recorded saying that "only an idiot or a thief" would work for 6,000 Zlotys (1,500 Euros) per month, calling it a "poverty wage". Poland's richest man, Jan Kulczyk, was also mentioned in these recording, leading many to believe that previous deals between his firms and the Polish government were not won legitimately."

Dreams of further EU integration, tax cuts and of joining the Euro were at the forefront of voter's minds during this time, and yet, it was not to last.\n\nFortunately for Poland, the EU sovereign debt crisis and 2008 global reccession had little effect on the Polish economy. At a time where all of Poland's neighbours were facing budget cuts and mass unemployments, Poland's economy only continued to grow, albeit at a pace less than which it could have been.\n\nDespite this, things are not looking too good for PO in the polls. As it stands, the election seems close between them and PiS, and the question on everybody's minds is - can they pull off a third?"

They have taken overt military action against neighbouring Ukraine, and their propagandists openly make threats against our own country.\n\nWhile most in Poland acknowledge this as a threat to our nation by proxy, our next steps are up for much debate. Some believe that we should further align ourselves with NATO, and co-operate more closely with the Americans. Others, however, belive that NATO's lacking response to the Ukrainian crisis is a sign that NATO is brain-dead and does not care for European security, and that Poland should take matters into her own hands."

The Armed Forces Operational Command is tasked with the development and testing of doctrine, ensuring inter-operability with fellow NATO states, and keeping the army organised in times of war.\n\nThe Armed Forces General Command is subordinate to the General Chief of Staff, allocating funds for the procurement and maintenance of equipment and ensuring the combat-readiness of our soldiers.\n\nAs with any large scale government reorganisation, however, this will take time. Military bureaucrats expect that it will take up to two years for the transformation to be fully complete, but it's benefits are set to be worth it."

Other governments, notably Viktor Orban's Hungary, have stated that they will allow as few migrants to settle within their borders as possible.\n\nThe government of [POL.get_current_pm_name] is faces a tough choice about which of these paths to follow, and how strict our immigration policy should be more generally."

However, the coal industry has been linked to many premature deaths and health problems by professionals, and it is no longer as profitable as it once was. Furthermore, with reports coming out about Poland being one of the largest polluters in the EU, and an increased focus on fighting climate change by the international community, many believe it is time to implement large-scale cuts to our coal subsidies.\n\nHowever, this is not a popular decision in our coal producing regions, notably Silesia. Several coal-based trade unions have approached us with a plan to slowly transistion away from coal by 2049 while subsidising the creation of renewable energy methods in these areas, though critics argue this would be far too late and wouldn't meet our obligations set forth by the Paris climate agreement."

 poland_court_event.4.desc:0 "With Prawo i Sprawiedliwość claiming victory in the recent parliamentary elections, President [POL.GetLeader] has sworn in five new judges appointed by PiS and Prime Minister [POL.get_current_pm_name]. However, as three judges were appointed by Platforma Obywatelska during their term but not sworn in by [POL.POL_get_president_surname], the Constitutional Tribunal under President Andrzej Rzepliński has declared them unconsitutional. According to them, the three justices who were due to take over during PO's term are the legitimate justices, and the latter two of PiS's appointments are as well.\n\nSome members of PiS think that this is acceptable, as several PO-appointed justices' terms will expire during the next four years of our government. Most members however, think we should campaign to have all five of our justices put on the court, as it will make it easier for our government to pass the legislation that we have planned for Poland."

 poland_court_event.5.desc:0 "With tensions heating up between our government and the Constitutional Tribunal, we are set to vote on a controversial law to end this dispute once and for all. Our new law will introduce three main changes to strengthen our position over these anti-Polish bureaucrats.\n\nFirstly, justices are to only be able to make decisions if thirteen out of fifteen justices are actively sat on the court as opposed to the previous nine out of fifteen.\n\nSecondly, any ruling will now require a supermajority of justices, as opposed to a simple majority.\n\nFinally, any justice can be dismissed by a simple majority vote by the Sejm, by the President, or by the Ministry of Justice.\n\nWhile our opposition claims that these are illegal and dictatorial, we know them to be otherwise. We are removing power from unelected bureaucrats who wish to stifle the progress of our government, as it is entirely legal for the government to change the rules effecting the court as per the constitution - which is what we were given our electoral mandate to do!"
