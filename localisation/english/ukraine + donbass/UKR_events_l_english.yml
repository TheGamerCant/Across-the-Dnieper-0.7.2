 ukraine.1.desc:0 "For several weeks now, Ukrainians have been camping and protesting in the streets of [92.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] over Yanukovych's pro-Russian policies, with his shootdown of the Ukraine-EU trade and political co-operation agreement being the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nThese protests are the largest in Ukraine's history as an independent state, and the actions taken now by both the protestors and the government will have consequences for decades to come."

 ukraine.4.desc:0 "After weeks of pain, destruction and over 100 dead comrades, members of the Rada voted Yanukovych out of power and caused Yanukovych to flee the country!\n\nThis may be a great day for Ukraine and her newborn democracy, but let us never forget those who lost their lives for us to get here."

 ukraine.7.desc:0 "[UKR.GetLeader] sat quietly at his desk in [94.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. He had expected it all to be over now, and that he and his family would be back in [92.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].\n\nYanukovych however, is not one to go quietly.

 ukraine.15.t:0 "Donetsk Riots"
 ukraine.15.desc:0 "Over the past several days, the situation in the east has deteriorated to such an extent that the very existence of Ukraine may be under threat. Rioters in Donetsk seized control over the Regional State Administration building, where they occupied it for several hours before being removed by the SBU. This has caused many in [92.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] to worry that left unchecked, a civil war may be imminent."

 ukraine.17.t:0 "Results Of The 2014 Election"
 ukraine.17.desc:0 "After all the votes have been counted, it would seem that there has been no clear winner in the 2014 election, with votes being split between Petro Poroshenko, Dmytro Yarosh and Yulia Tymoshenko in that order.\n\nAs such, the next election will see Poroshenko go head-to-head with Yarosh for the presidency."

 ukraine.19.t:0 "Petro Poroshenko Announces His Candidacy"
 ukraine.19.desc:0 "Nicknamed the 'chocolate king' for his large confectionary empire, Petro Poroshenko, independent MP, has announced his candidacy with the backing of the UDAR party. He campaigns on promises of de-Russification and de-oligarchisation, though his large sums of wealth and ownership over Ukrainian news networks cast some doubt on how much he will follow through with the latter promise."
 ukraine.19.a:0 "Free chocolate for everybody!"

 ukraine.20.t:0 "Yulia Tymoshenko Released From Prison"
 ukraine.20.desc:0 "After years in jail and facing declining health, Yulia Tymoshenko walks a free woman.\n\nShe was released a few days ago when the rada voted overwhelmingly to annul Yanukovych's charges against her, and today the rada also voted to give her legal and political amnesty, allowing her back into public office.

 ukraine.21.a:0 "Appoint Denis Berezovsky in his place"

 ukraine.22.t:0 "Denis Berezovsky Defects!"
 ukraine.22.desc:0 "Just one day after his appointment as chief of the Ukrainian navy, Denis Berezovsky has defected to Russia!\n\nThis is a great embarrassment to the Ukrainian armed forces, only highlighting the malaise and indifference many show towards the defence of Ukraine, as well as towards Ukraine in general."
 ukraine.22.a:0 "You've got to be fucking kidding me"

 ukraine.23.t:0 "Sergei Yeliseyev Defects To Us"
 ukraine.23.desc:0 "It would seem that the chief of the Ukrainian navy Sergei Yeliseyev has recognised his nation's inferiority to us, and has decided to abandon the sinking ship that is Ukraine. This is a great propaganda victory for us, and gives legitimacy to our actions in Crimea, as it shows the discontent with the current government in [92.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."
 ukraine.23.a:0 "Welcome aboard!"
 
 ukraine.24.t:0 "Denis Berezovsky Defects To Us"
 ukraine.24.desc:0 "A day after being appointed the new head of the Ukrainian navy, Denis Berezoksy has followed in his predecessor's footsteps and defected to us."

 ukraine.25.t:0 "Little Green Men"
 ukraine.25.desc:0 "Earlier today, Russian troops stationed in Sevastopol took control over the naval base, and have moved to take control over the rest of the peninsula.\n\nDubbed the 'little green men' due to them having no insignia, they allow Russia some plausible deniability in the actions taken in Crimea. The Russian government has refused to comment on the situation, claiming that Crimea is simply undergoing political turmoil and wishes to join Russia."
 ukraine.25.a:0 "They'll pay for this"
 ukraine.25.b:0 "...with blood! (Play as Crimea)"

 ukraine.26.t:0 "The Donbass War"
 ukraine.26.desc:0 "Months of chaos has culminated in the breakaway of several of our eastern oblasts, claiming that they are no longer represented by the government in [92.GetCapitalVictoryPointName].

 ukraine.26.f:0 "Glory to Novorossiya!"

 ukraine.27.t:0 "Cooperation With The Azov Battalion?"
 ukraine.27.desc:0 "Over the past decades, Ukraine's oligarchy have turned to street mobsters for 'enforcers,' using them to cement their rule over the country and provide muscle for their operations. Some of these men are politicised, and have formed far-right paramilitary groups in Ukraine.\n\nNow the Azov Battalion comes to us and offers their services in defeating the rebels. Doing so would give us a lifeline when we need it most, but would come at the risk of further angering the Russian speaking population within our country."
 ukraine.27.a:0 "Desperate times call for desperate measures"
 ukraine.27.tt:0 "§GSpawns four Azov Regiments, as well as gaining two generals.§!"
 ukraine.27.b:0 "There is no need for their assistance"

 ukraine.28.t:0 "Helping The People's Republics?"
 ukraine.28.desc:0 "With a little help on our part, the situation in eastern Ukraine has deteriorated to the point of civil war.\n\nHowever, the forces that are currently under their banners are nowhere near enough to win a modern war, even against an opponent as weak as Ukraine. Sending troops and saboteurs would be an easy way to rectify this, but would not go unnoticed by Ukraine and the international community at large."
 ukraine.28.a:0 "Send in the troops"
 ukraine.28.tt:0 "We will be able to send volunteers to the people's republics"
 ukraine.28.b:0 "They are needed elsewhere"
 
 ukraine.29.t:0 "Help From The Motherland"
 ukraine.29.desc:0 "After their success in Crimea, it would appear that [SOV.GetNameDef] has decided to give us aid in the form of military personnel and equipment.\n\nSoldiers without markings are crossing the border as we speak, and our cause grows stronger by the day."

 ukraine.31.desc:0 "It would appear that many in the Ukrainian army are dissatisfied with [92.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], choosing to defect to us instead of fighting for the government that treats them like cannon fodder"
 ukraine.31.a:0 "They recognise who will emerge victorious"

 ukraine.32.t:0 "Send In The FSB?"
 ukraine.32.desc:0 "With our success in Crimea, many in the government believe that similar operations can be pulled off in the rest of Ukraine. The FSB has drawn up the plans and [SOV.GetLeader] has given the green light. All that is needed is for the men on the ground to carry out the operation."
 ukraine.32.a:0 "To secure our frontier against the west!"
 ukraine.32.b:0 "To unite Russians everywhere!"
 ukraine.32.tt:0 "As we did in Crimea, we will send the FSB into the Donbass"

 ukraine.33.t:0 "Those Damned Russians"
 ukraine.33.desc:0 "Emboldened by their actions in Crimea, Russian troops have crossed the border and started to distribute arms to local militia groups, only escalating the situation. Similar to in Crimea, their soldiers are without markings, allowing the Russian government to refute claims of interference in our country's affairs."

Over the past two weeks, they have conducted a daring raid hundreds of kilometres behind enemy lines in order to help Ukrainian troops stranded deep behind enemy lines at the Russian border, and as such more than 3000 soldiers have returned home from the jaws of death. This is not only a strategic victory, but also a propaganda victory, right when we need one most."

He and his family become the most powerful people in Ukraine, as the country's security services, oligarchs, and society treat them as gods amongst men.\n\nThe show has been uploaded onto Youtube and has received huge popularity, as it tackles issues facing everyday Ukrainians, and has propelled Zelenskyy to further popularity."
